# PHPAuth

PHPAuth is a secure authentication class for PHP. 
It features improved passwordhashing using the hash_pbkdf2 function and 3 different salts, as well as improved coding layout, the use of private and public functions, seperating the most decisive functions from the frontend. 
There is also enhanced logging functionality, logging all attempts at logging in, creating accounts etc, including an IP and a timestamp.
With PHPAuth, you'll also get a tracking system with it, so you'll be able to track your visitors and do site analytics
